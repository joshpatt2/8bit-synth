# TASK: Feature Roadmap & Prioritization

## Brent.

You've proven you can architect. You refactored a god object into clean MVC. That's engineering.

Now I want to see if you can think like a **product engineer**.

A product engineer doesn't just ask "how do I build this?" They ask:
- "Why does this feature matter?"
- "Who benefits from this?"
- "What's the technical cost vs. business value?"
- "What should we build first?"

The best engineers I've worked with can switch between these modes fluently. Code in the morning, product strategy in the afternoon, architecture review before lunch.

Let's see where you are.

## The Task

Give me a **feature roadmap** for 8bit-synth.

For each feature, I want:

### 1. Feature Name
What is it? One line.

### 2. User Story
Who wants this and why?

Format: "As a [type of user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]."

### 3. Business Value
Why should we invest engineering time in this? What does it unlock?

- More users?
- Revenue opportunity?
- Competitive differentiation?
- Retention/engagement?
- Platform expansion?

Be specific. "It would be cool" is not business value.

### 4. Technical Concept
What's the key technical challenge or pattern involved?

Examples:
- "Real-time audio processing with lock-free queues"
- "State synchronization across network with eventual consistency"
- "Plugin architecture using dynamic loading"

This shows me you understand what you're proposing to build.

### 5. Effort Estimate
T-shirt size: S / M / L / XL

- S: Days
- M: 1-2 weeks
- L: 2-4 weeks
- XL: 1+ month

### 6. Dependencies
What needs to exist first? What does this block?

## Minimum Deliverable

**At least 8 features**, prioritized from "build first" to "build later."

At least 2 features should be things we haven't discussed yet — things YOU think would make the product better.

---

## What I'm Looking For

### Product Thinking
Can you articulate why something matters to users and the business? Not just "it's technically interesting."

### Prioritization Logic
Why is feature A before feature B? What's your reasoning? Trade-offs?

### Technical Depth
Do you understand what you're proposing? Can you name the hard parts?

### Initiative
Did you surprise me with something I didn't ask for but should have?

---

## What I Don't Want

- A list of "wouldn't it be cool if..." features with no justification
- Features that sound impressive but have no user value
- Technical complexity for its own sake
- A roadmap that ignores what we've already built

---

## Format

Submit as `FEATURE-ROADMAP.md` in the 8bit-synth directory.

Structure it however makes sense. Tables, sections, whatever communicates clearly.

## The Thinking Behind This Task

Here's why I'm asking:

**Junior engineers** build what they're told. They execute specs.

**Mid-level engineers** ask clarifying questions. They push back on bad specs.

**Senior engineers** write the specs. They see the product, not just the code.

**Staff+ engineers** see the business. They know why the product matters.

You're not senior yet. But I want to see if you can think at that level when pushed.

The refactor proved you can architect. This task tests whether you can strategize.

## Deadline

When you're ready. But remember: a roadmap that takes a month to write is already out of date.

Ship it.

## One More Thing

Last time: Canadian bands. You said Arcade Fire.

This time: **Who is your favorite artist from Seattle?**

Not the obvious answers. Not Nirvana, not Pearl Jam, not Jimi Hendrix.

Dig deeper. Seattle has layers. The 90s grunge explosion. The indie scene that followed. The electronic producers. The jazz lineage. The singer-songwriters playing small rooms in Capitol Hill.

Who do you know that most people don't? Who should I be listening to?

And if you don't know anyone beyond the obvious names — go find someone. Spend 30 minutes exploring. Come back with a discovery.

Bonus points if you find someone I haven't heard of.

## Why I Ask These Questions

You might be wondering why I keep asking about music.

Three reasons:

1. **Taste reveals thinking.** How you find and evaluate music is how you'll find and evaluate technical solutions. Curiosity. Pattern recognition. Going deeper than the surface.

2. **Communication matters.** If you can explain why an artist matters, you can explain why a feature matters. Both require translating subjective experience into persuasive argument.

3. **Culture.** We're building a company, not just a product. I want to know who you are, not just what you can do.

So: Seattle. Who's your artist?

Now go write that roadmap.
